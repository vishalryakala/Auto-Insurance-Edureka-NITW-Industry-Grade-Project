# Edureka-NITW-Industry-Grade-Project

This Project contains Auto Insurance Project as a Industry Grade Project for Edureka NITW AI ML PG Program

*Aim of the Project:-*
The aim of the project is to build a Machine Learning Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.


*Use Cases:-*
The model shall mainly support the following use cases:
1. Conquering Market Share: Capture market share by lowering the prices of the premium for the customers, who are least likely to claim.
2. Risk Management: Charge the right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim insurance in the coming year
3. Smooth Processing: Reduce the complexity of pricing models. Most of the transactions are happening online with larger customer attributes (thanks to the internet and social media). Harness the power of huge data to build complex ML models
4. Increased Profits: As per industry estimate 1% reduction in the claim can boost profit by 10%. So, through the ML model, we can identify and deny the insurance to the driver who will make a claim. Thus, ensuring reduced claim outgo and increased profit.
